# dobsonian 

f/4 8" Mini Dobsonian build: 3D printed PLA prototype 
Why? Building a travel-size Dobsonian provides benefits for astronomers and physicsits, or just anyone, to easily access observation of the solar system. As a first build, this provides easy collaboration and community engagement. The 8" opening is such a versatile size and a great starting point.


[SIMULATION]
Thanks to Newt-Web Telescope Design, we are able to view how the telescope may work. Test our prototype at this link: [https://stellafane.org/tm/newt-web/newt-web.html](url)

[OPTICS]
- The primary mirror has a 200 mm diameter, thickness of 24 mm, FL of 800 mm and a f/4 number, which means that there is a pretty good amount of light that is gathered. For $355: [https://agenaastro.com/gso-parabolic-primary-telescope-mirror-8-f-4-ad048.html](url)
  - The primary mirror is the most expensive part of the mirror and gathers the light. Then, it is reflected by the secondary mirror to an eyepiece that can be viewed by the viewer,
    or alternatively, taken by a camera
- The secondary mirror is also the diagonal mirror that is meant to bend the reflected light cone 90 degrees. It is positioned 45 degrees to the optical axis and is elliptical. Our secondary mirror has a minor axis radius is 50 mm and the major axis raidus is 70 mm with a thickness of 10 mm. For $40: [https://agenaastro.com/gso-elliptical-secondary-mirror-50-mm.html](url). The obstruction is 25% though... (minor axis / primary diameter). Great source: [https://www.bbastrodesigns.com/NewtDesigner.html#diagonal](url)
- The focuser holds the eyepiece and allows it to be moved along the optical axis. Crayford focusers have become the standard in Newtonian telescopes, and this one from Amazon is for $85, which is surprisingly affordable.

- Eyepiece: The eyepiece magnifies the image produced by the primary mirror. The one we will be using is a 25 mm Plossl eyepiece with a 1.25" aperture. It provides us a magnification of 32x! It has a 52 degree apparent field of view. For $30.95: [https://agenaastro.com/gso-25mm-plossl-eyepiece.html](url).

[CAD]
We are using Onshape to design the telescope. https://cad.onshape.com/documents/947583d8cc9b64ec4d34047e/w/2b3ea990f9b1bc6be98d422e/e/89a6bf9574a54e25c61e8e6a?renderMode=0&uiState=670203a39945fd112926d11d
